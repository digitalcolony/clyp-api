# Clyp.it API Code

Years ago [Clyp.it](https://clyp.it/) offered a service to allow users with no accounts to upload audio files via their API for free. Good times! This script uses CURL, PHP, and MYSQL to post audio to their server, collect the response, and write it to a MYSQL database.

I believe the free days are gone. This code may or may not still work if they still support their API.
